# ANOVA  - Lab

## Introduction

In this lab, you'll get some brief practice generating an ANOVA table (AOV) and interpreting its output. You'll also perform some investigations to compare the method to the t-tests you previously employed to conduct hypothesis testing.

## Objectives

In this lab you will: 

- Use ANOVA for testing multiple pairwise comparisons 
- Interpret results of an ANOVA and compare them to a t-test

## Load the data

Start by loading in the data stored in the file `'ToothGrowth.csv'`: 


```python
# Your code here
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('ToothGrowth.csv')
df.head()
```




<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>len</th>
      <th>supp</th>
      <th>dose</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>4.2</td>
      <td>VC</td>
      <td>0.5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>11.5</td>
      <td>VC</td>
      <td>0.5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>7.3</td>
      <td>VC</td>
      <td>0.5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>5.8</td>
      <td>VC</td>
      <td>0.5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>6.4</td>
      <td>VC</td>
      <td>0.5</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



## Generate the ANOVA table

Now generate an ANOVA table in order to analyze the influence of the medication and dosage:  


```python
#Your code here
import statsmodels.api as sm
from statsmodels.formula.api import ols

formula = 'len ~ C(supp) + C(dose)'
lm = ols(formula, df).fit()
table = sm.stats.anova_lm(lm, typ=2)
print(table)
```

                   sum_sq    df          F        PR(>F)
    C(supp)    205.350000   1.0  14.016638  4.292793e-04
    C(dose)   2426.434333   2.0  82.810935  1.871163e-17
    Residual   820.425000  56.0        NaN           NaN


## Interpret the output

Make a brief comment regarding the statistics and the effect of supplement and dosage on tooth length: 


```python
# Both dose and supplement type are impactful. At first glance, dosage seems to be the more impactful of the two.
```

## Compare to t-tests

Now that you've had a chance to generate an ANOVA table, its interesting to compare the results to those from the t-tests you were working with earlier. With that, start by breaking the data into two samples: those given the OJ supplement, and those given the VC supplement. Afterward, you'll conduct a t-test to compare the tooth length of these two different samples: 


```python
# Your code here
oj_lengths = df[df.supp=='OJ']['len']
vc_lengths = df[df.supp=='VC']['len']
```

Now run a t-test between these two groups and print the associated two-sided p-value: 


```python
# Calculate the 2-sided p-value for a t-test comparing the two supplement groups 
from scipy import stats

stats.ttest_ind(oj_lengths, vc_lengths, equal_var=False)[1]
```




    0.06063450788093387



## A 2-Category ANOVA F-test is equivalent to a 2-tailed t-test!

Now, recalculate an ANOVA F-test with only the supplement variable. An ANOVA F-test between two categories is the same as performing a 2-tailed t-test! So, the p-value in the table should be identical to your calculation above.

> Note: there may be a small fractional difference (>0.001) between the two values due to a rounding error between implementations. 


```python
# Your code here; conduct an ANOVA F-test of the oj and vc supplement groups.
# Compare the p-value to that of the t-test above. 
# They should match (there may be a tiny fractional difference due to rounding errors in varying implementations)
formula = 'len ~ C(supp)'
lm = ols(formula, df).fit()
table = sm.stats.anova_lm(lm, typ=2)
print(table)
```

                   sum_sq    df         F    PR(>F)
    C(supp)    205.350000   1.0  3.668253  0.060393
    Residual  3246.859333  58.0       NaN       NaN


## Run multiple t-tests

While the 2-category ANOVA test is identical to a 2-tailed t-test, performing multiple t-tests leads to the multiple comparisons problem. To investigate this, look at the various sample groups you could create from the 2 features: 


```python
for group in df.groupby(['supp', 'dose'])['len']:
    group_name = group[0]
    data = group[1]
    print(group_name)
```

    ('OJ', 0.5)
    ('OJ', 1.0)
    ('OJ', 2.0)
    ('VC', 0.5)
    ('VC', 1.0)
    ('VC', 2.0)


While bad practice, examine the effects of calculating multiple t-tests with the various combinations of these. To do this, generate all combinations of the above groups. For each pairwise combination, calculate the p-value of a 2-sided t-test. Print the group combinations and their associated p-value for the two-sided t-test.


```python
# Your code here; reuse your t-test code above to calculate the p-value for a 2-sided t-test
# for all combinations of the supplement-dose groups listed above. 
# (Since there isn't a control group, compare each group to every other group.)

from itertools import combinations

groups = [group[0] for group in df.groupby(['supp', 'dose'])['len']]
combos = combinations(groups, 2)
for combo in combos:
    supp1 = combo[0][0]
    dose1 = combo[0][1]
    supp2 = combo[1][0]
    dose2 = combo[1][1]
    sample1 = df[(df.supp == supp1) & (df.dose == dose1)]['len']
    sample2 = df[(df.supp == supp2) & (df.dose == dose2)]['len']
    p = stats.ttest_ind(sample1, sample2, equal_var=False)[1]
    print(combo, p)

    # Note that while ANOVA also concluded that all factors were significant, 
    # these p-values are substantially lower.
```

    (('OJ', 0.5), ('OJ', 1.0)) 8.784919055161479e-05
